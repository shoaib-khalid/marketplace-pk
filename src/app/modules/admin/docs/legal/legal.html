Users have approximately two weeks to bring up and settle any issues with the billing of Subscription Fees.</li>

Your Account will be reactivated upon your payment of any outstanding Fees, plus the Fees applicable to your next billing cycle. You may not be able to access your Account or your storefront during any period of suspension. If the outstanding Fees remain unpaid for 60 days following the date of suspension, DeliverIn reserves the right to terminate your Account.</li>
